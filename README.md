# pgen
## A password generator/wallet.

pgen is a bash script that generates random passwords (in either base64 or hex), saves a username/nickname alongside, and writes the information directly to a hidden log file.

#This script was inspired by the work off HackerSploit from his video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5552IJp7tU

#All code expanded beyond the scope of that video written exclusively by thenotoriouslogank.
